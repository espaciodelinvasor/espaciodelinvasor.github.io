I have a strong passion for data science both in work and in personal life. I strive to see how to extract value from data and use it in real life situations. 

Check my pet projects in the "Fun" section of the tab "projects". In one of my pet projects I used the data from a GPS-tracker to create behavioral models of my cat. 

Check my many work projects under the "work" section of the tab "projects".
