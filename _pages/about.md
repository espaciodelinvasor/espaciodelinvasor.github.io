I have a strong passion for data science both in work and in personal life. I strive to create value from data and use it in real life situations. My main strength is to understand challenges and translate them into data science solutions.

 Check my "work" and "fun" [projects](/projects/) for more information on my expertise. As alternative, you may check my [keywords](/keywords/) . 
 
 My work projects include a variety of industries and applications such as pulp & paper, mining, steel production, district heating, railway (infrastructure and rolling stock), military air fleets, hauling vehicles, HVAC systems, NDT ultrasonic testing, and cybersecurity.
 
  My pet projects resolve creative problems which I find in my daily life, such as the use of a GPS-tracker to create behavioral models of my cat. 

I've had major participation in a variety of  [products, innovations and tools](/products/). These relate e.g. to computer vision, LIDAR processing, design of industrial control systems,  ultrasonic NDT,  and data quality analytics.  


I'm proud of my hobbies, which are based on striving for incremental improvements and which challenge me both physically and mentally. Don't ask me about any of them or I will try to hook you in.
