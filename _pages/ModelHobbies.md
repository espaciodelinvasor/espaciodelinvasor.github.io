I like a variety of Model Hobbies, such as building dioramas and painting miniature figures. 

> Building dioramas can be a very easy and rewarding family activity. A forest landscape can be quickly built using a base of paper mach√©  (small pieces of paper mixed with water and white glue) and just gluing things such as stones that you find on the street, and other things such as modelism trees and grass. 

One afternoon when my 3 years old child was sick, I decided to drive him through his first diorama. The results 2 hours later were fabulous. 



<div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.html path="assets/img/Diorama.jpg" title="example image" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
</div>


Miniature painting is tough and time consumingand requires a lot of learning.
