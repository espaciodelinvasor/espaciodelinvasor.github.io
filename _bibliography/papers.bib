  abstract={This paper deals with DRGA analysis for uncer-
tain systems. Uncertainties in a process model can be translated
into uncertainties in the DRGA which might invalidate the
decision on the variable paring in decentralized control. Bounds
for the uncertainties in the DRGA of a multivariable process
are derived for a given nominal process model with known
uncertainty region. The resulting uncertainty region for the
DRGA is used to assess the validity of decisions based on the
nominal DRGA. The methodology for the computation of the
bounds is currently restricted to the 2-by-2 case. Beside an
explanatory example, a case study on a coal injection vessel is
conducted and discussed.},

  abstract={This paper presents a new application software for control configuration selection of interconnected industrial processes, called ProMoVis. Moreover, ProMoVis is able to visualize process models and process layout at the physical level together with the control system dynamics. The software consists of a builder part where the visual representation of the interconnected process is created and an analyzer part where the process is analyzed using different control configuration selection tools.

The conceptual idea of the software is presented and the subsequent design and implementation of ProMoVis are discussed. The implemented analysis methods are briefly described including their usage and implementation aspects. The use of ProMoVis is demonstrated by an application study on the stock preparation process at SCA Obbola AB, Sweden. The results of this study are compared with the currently used control strategy.

The study indicates that ProMoVis introduces a systematic and comprehensive way to perform control configuration selection. ProMoVis has been released under the Apache Open Source license.},

  abstract={The aim of this article is to introduce a novel sparse controller design for the temperature control of an experimental walking beam furnace in steel industry. Adequate tracking of temperature references is essential for the quality of the heated slabs. However, the design of the temperature control is hindered by the multivariable (non-square) dynamic behavior of the furnace. These dynamics include significant loop interactions and time delays. Furthermore, a novel datadriven model, based on real life experimental data that relies on a subspace state representation in a closed loop approach is introduced. In the sequel, the derived model is utilized to investigate the controller's structure. By applying the relative gain array approach a decentralized feedback controller is designed. However, in spite of the optimal and sparse design of the controller, there exists interaction between loops. By analyzing the interaction between the inputs-outputs with the σ 2 Gramian-based interaction methodology, a decoupled multi-variable controller is implied. The simulation result, based on the experimental modeling of the furnace, shows that the controller can successfully decrease the interaction between the loops and track the reference temperature set-points.},

In this paper we address the main objective which is the reduction of energy consumption and emissions along with the enhancement of the autonomy of the controlled process by online modelling and uncertainty-aware predictive control. We propose a risk-sensitive model selection procedure which makes use of the modern theory of risk measures and obtain dynamical models using process data from our experimental setting: a walking beam furnace at Swerea MEFOS. We use a scenario-based model predictive controller to track given temperature references at the three heating zones of the furnace and we train a classifier which predicts possible drops in the excess of Oxygen in each heating zone below acceptable levels. This information is then used to recalibrate the controller in order to maintain a high quality of combustion, therefore, higher thermal efficiency and lower emissions},

a novel cloud computing infrastructure for big data analytics

of Process Analyzer Techniques (PAT), big data and wireless
technologies have created a new environment in which almost
all stages of the industrial process can be recorded and utilized,
not only for safety, but also for real time optimization. Based
on analysis of historical sensor data, machine learning based
optimization models can be developed and deployed in real time
closed control loops. However, still the local implementation
of those systems requires a huge investment in hardware and
software, as a direct result of the big data nature of sensors
data being recorded continuously. The current technological
advancements in cloud computing for big data processing, open
new opportunities for the industry, while acting as an enabler
for a significant reduction in costs, making the technology
available to plants of all sizes. The main contribution of this
article stems from the presentation for a fist time ever of a
pilot cloud based architecture for the application of a data

of Process Control. As it will be presented, these developments
have been carried in close relationship with the process industry
and pave a way for a generalized application of the cloud based

cient and well-established methods in the computer vision community in
a state of the art vision-based system for Micro Aerial Vehicle (MAV)
navigation in dark tunnels. These methods include Otsu’s threshold and
Moore-Neighborhood object tracing. The vision system can detect the
position of low-illuminated tunnels in image frame by exploiting the in-
herent darkness in the longitudinal direction. In the sequel, it is converted
from the pixel coordinates to the heading rate command of the MAV for
adjusting the heading towards the center of the tunnel. The efficacy of
the proposed framework has been evaluated in multiple experimental
field trials in an underground mine in Sweden, thus demonstrating the
capability of low-cost and resource-constrained aerial vehicles to fly au-
tonomously through tunnel confined spaces},

This leads to subjective and fashionable classifications of technologies as “smart” or “not smart”. Undoubtedly, technologies such as vehicle cruise controllers could have been considered as smart in the past but are now too conventional to be considered as such (Santacana and Rackliffe in Power and Energy, 41–48, 2010). A smart parking technology using RFID technology to check in and check out vehicles (Pala and Inanç in Smart parking applications using RFID technology. 2007 1st Annual RFID Eurasia, 2007) is now very conventional. Complex reasoning is subjective to evaluate, and a general requirement is that smart technology should be able to perform its task which is thought to require human intelligence. ",

used and on the subjectivity of the data consumer. The approach proposed in this paper to address this challenge is to employ a semi-automated user-guided
Data Quality assessment. This paper introduces a generic framework for data quality analytics which is mainly composed by a set of software units to
perform semi-automated Data Quality analytics and a set of Graphical User Interfaces to enable the user to guide the Data Quality assessment. The
framework has been implemented and can be customized according to the needs of the purpose and of the consumer. The framework has been instantiated
in a case study on Long-hole drill rigs, where several Data Quality issues have been discovered and their root cause investigated},

ing framework for detecting the number of tunnel junctions
in subterranean environments based on acquired 2D point
clouds. The implementation of the framework provides valuable
information for high level mission planners to navigate an
aerial platform in unknown areas or robot homing missions.
The framework utilizes spectral clustering, which is capable
of uncovering hidden structures from connected data points
lying on non-linear manifolds. The spectral clustering algorithm
computes a spectral embedding of the original 2D point cloud
by utilizing the eigen decomposition of a matrix that is derived
from the pairwise similarities of these points. We validate
the developed framework using multiple data-sets, collected
from multiple realistic simulations, as well as from real flights
in underground environments, demonstrating the performance
and merits of the proposed methodology.},

  abstract={Degraded Subterranean environments are an attractive case for miniature aerial vehicles, since there is a constant need to increase the safety operations in underground mines. The starting point for integrating aerial vehicles in the mining process is the capability to reliably navigate along tunnels. Inspired by recent advancements, this paper presents a collection of different, experimentally verified, methods tackling the problem of MAVs heading regulation while navigating in dark and textureless tunnel areas. More specifically, four different methods are presented in this work with the common goal to identify open space in the tunnel and align the MAV heading using either visual sensor in methods a) single image depth estimation, b) darkness contour detection, c) Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) regression and 2D Lidar sensor in method d) range geometry. For the works a)-c) the dark scene in the middle of the tunnel is considered as open space and is processed and converted to yaw rate command, while d) examines the geometry of the range measurements to calculate the yaw rate command. Experimental results from real underground tunnel demonstrate the performance of the methods in the field, while setting the ground for further developments in the aerial robotics community.}

of viable action alternatives in a complex and dynamic operational context. As a proof-of-concept, we have utilized
a full-stack application framework to implement a decision support demonstrator for operational aircraft

  abstract={Managing assets in railway, including infrastructure and rolling stock, efficiently and effectively is challenging. The emerging digital technologies and Artificial Intelligence (AI) are expected to augment the decision making in Asset Management (AM) and Fleet Management (FM). The AI technologies need to be adapted to the specific needs of any industrial domain, e.g. railways, to facilitate the implementation and achievement of the overall business goals. This adaptation is denoted as ‘Industrial AI’(IAI). IAI for railways infrastructure and rolling stock, is dependent on an appropriate technology roadmap reflecting necessary know-hows. The IAI roadmap aims to provide a strategic and executive plan to augment managing railway assets i.e. ‘Augmented Asset Management (AAM)’. AAM can be applied through an end-to-end secure platform for e.g. data sharing among stakeholders, the development of analytics, and model sharing through distributed computing. AAM in railways can be enhanced through implementation of a generic fleet management (FM) approach. In the FM approach, any population of assets with common characteristics and also the relationship of the asset to the fleet is considered. This paper aims to develop and propose a concept for AAM enabled through IAI and digital technologies to provide augmented decision support through a secure platform, for AM in railways. A FM approach towards a holistic operation and maintenance of assets, based on a System of Systems thinking, for AAM in railways is applied for population of infrastructure assets and rolling stock assets with common characteristics. Finally, a taxonomy of issues and challenges, in the application of AAM to FM in railways is provided. The data for this taxonomy has been collected from railway organizations through iterative rounds of interviews. This taxonomy can be used for research and development of frameworks, approaches, technologies, and methodologies for AAM in railways.},

  abstract={The ongoing digital transformation is changing asset management in the railway industry.
Emerging digital technologies and Artificial Intelligence is expected to facilitate decision-making in
management, operation, and maintenance of railway by providing an integrated data-driven and
model-driven solution. An important aspect when developing decision-support solutions based on
AI and digital technology is the users’ experience. User experience design process aims to create
relevance, context-awareness, and meaningfulness for the end-user. In railway contexts, it is believed
that applying a human-centric design model in the development of AI-based artefacts, will enhance
the usability of the solution, which will have a positive impact on the decision-making processes. In
this research, the applicability of such advanced technologies i.e., Virtual Reality, Mixed Reality, and
AI have been reviewed for the railway asset management. To carry out this research work, literature
review has been conducted related to available Virtual Reality/Augmented Reality/Mixed Reality
technologies and their applications within railway industry. It has been found that these technologies
are available, but not applied in railway asset management. Thus, the aim of this paper is to propose
a human-centric design model for the enhancement of railway asset management using Artificial
Intelligence, Virtual Reality, and Mixed Reality technologies. The practical implication of the findings
from this work will benefit in increased efficiency and effectiveness of the operation and maintenance
processes in railway.},

The required effort can be optimized with the use of LiDAR technologies, which support the process of collecting data related to spatial information such as location, geometry, and position. Sharing such data in multi-stakeholder environments is hindered due to competition, confidentiality, and security requirements. Multi-stakeholder environments favor the use of decentralized creation and update mechanisms with reduced data exchange. Such mechanisms are facilitated by Federated Learning, where the learning process is performed at the data owner’s location. Two case studies are presented in this paper, where LiDAR is used to extract information from industrial equipment as a part of the creation of a digital twin.},
