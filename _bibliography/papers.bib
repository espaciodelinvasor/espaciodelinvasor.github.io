  abstract={In a complete theory there is an element corresponding to each element of reality. A sufficient condition for the reality of a physical quantity is the possibility of predicting it with certainty, without disturbing the system. In quantum mechanics in the case of two physical quantities described by non-commuting operators, the knowledge of one precludes the knowledge of the other. Then either (1) the description of reality given by the wave function in quantum mechanics is not complete or (2) these two quantities cannot have simultaneous reality. Consideration of the problem of making predictions concerning a system on the basis of measurements made on another system that had previously interacted with it leads to the result that if (1) is false then (2) is also false. One is thus led to conclude that the description of reality as given by a wave function is not complete.},

  abstract={This article considers a low-cost and light weight platform
for the task of autonomous flying for inspection in underground mine
tunnels. The main contribution of this paper is integrating simple, effi-
cient and well-established methods in the computer vision community in
a state of the art vision-based system for Micro Aerial Vehicle (MAV)
navigation in dark tunnels. These methods include Otsu’s threshold and
Moore-Neighborhood object tracing. The vision system can detect the
position of low-illuminated tunnels in image frame by exploiting the in-
herent darkness in the longitudinal direction. In the sequel, it is converted
from the pixel coordinates to the heading rate command of the MAV for
adjusting the heading towards the center of the tunnel. The efficacy of
the proposed framework has been evaluated in multiple experimental
field trials in an underground mine in Sweden, thus demonstrating the
capability of low-cost and resource-constrained aerial vehicles to fly au-
tonomously through tunnel confined spaces},

The framework utilizes spectral clustering, which is capable
of uncovering hidden structures from connected data points
lying on non-linear manifolds. The spectral clustering algorithm
computes a spectral embedding of the original 2D point cloud
by utilizing the eigen decomposition of a matrix that is derived
from the pairwise similarities of these points. We validate
the developed framework using multiple data-sets, collected
from multiple realistic simulations, as well as from real flights
in underground environments, demonstrating the performance
and merits of the proposed methodology.},

  abstract={Degraded Subterranean environments are an attractive case for miniature aerial vehicles, since there is a constant need to increase the safety operations in underground mines. The starting point for integrating aerial vehicles in the mining process is the capability to reliably navigate along tunnels. Inspired by recent advancements, this paper presents a collection of different, experimentally verified, methods tackling the problem of MAVs heading regulation while navigating in dark and textureless tunnel areas. More specifically, four different methods are presented in this work with the common goal to identify open space in the tunnel and align the MAV heading using either visual sensor in methods a) single image depth estimation, b) darkness contour detection, c) Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) regression and 2D Lidar sensor in method d) range geometry. For the works a)-c) the dark scene in the middle of the tunnel is considered as open space and is processed and converted to yaw rate command, while d) examines the geometry of the range measurements to calculate the yaw rate command. Experimental results from real underground tunnel demonstrate the performance of the methods in the field, while setting the ground for further developments in the aerial robotics community.}

  abstract={Managing assets in railway, including infrastructure and rolling stock, efficiently and effectively is challenging. The emerging digital technologies and Artificial Intelligence (AI) are expected to augment the decision making in Asset Management (AM) and Fleet Management (FM). The AI technologies need to be adapted to the specific needs of any industrial domain, e.g. railways, to facilitate the implementation and achievement of the overall business goals. This adaptation is denoted as ‘Industrial AI’(IAI). IAI for railways infrastructure and rolling stock, is dependent on an appropriate technology roadmap reflecting necessary know-hows. The IAI roadmap aims to provide a strategic and executive plan to augment managing railway assets i.e. ‘Augmented Asset Management (AAM)’. AAM can be applied through an end-to-end secure platform for e.g. data sharing among stakeholders, the development of analytics, and model sharing through distributed computing. AAM in railways can be enhanced through implementation of a generic fleet management (FM) approach. In the FM approach, any population of assets with common characteristics and also the relationship of the asset to the fleet is considered. This paper aims to develop and propose a concept for AAM enabled through IAI and digital technologies to provide augmented decision support through a secure platform, for AM in railways. A FM approach towards a holistic operation and maintenance of assets, based on a System of Systems thinking, for AAM in railways is applied for population of infrastructure assets and rolling stock assets with common characteristics. Finally, a taxonomy of issues and challenges, in the application of AAM to FM in railways is provided. The data for this taxonomy has been collected from railway organizations through iterative rounds of interviews. This taxonomy can be used for research and development of frameworks, approaches, technologies, and methodologies for AAM in railways.},

  abstract={The ongoing digital transformation is changing asset management in the railway industry.
Emerging digital technologies and Artificial Intelligence is expected to facilitate decision-making in
management, operation, and maintenance of railway by providing an integrated data-driven and
model-driven solution. An important aspect when developing decision-support solutions based on
AI and digital technology is the users’ experience. User experience design process aims to create
relevance, context-awareness, and meaningfulness for the end-user. In railway contexts, it is believed
that applying a human-centric design model in the development of AI-based artefacts, will enhance
the usability of the solution, which will have a positive impact on the decision-making processes. In
this research, the applicability of such advanced technologies i.e., Virtual Reality, Mixed Reality, and
AI have been reviewed for the railway asset management. To carry out this research work, literature
review has been conducted related to available Virtual Reality/Augmented Reality/Mixed Reality
technologies and their applications within railway industry. It has been found that these technologies
are available, but not applied in railway asset management. Thus, the aim of this paper is to propose
a human-centric design model for the enhancement of railway asset management using Artificial
Intelligence, Virtual Reality, and Mixed Reality technologies. The practical implication of the findings
from this work will benefit in increased efficiency and effectiveness of the operation and maintenance
processes in railway.},

  abstract={Creation, maintenance, and update of digital twins are costly and time-consuming mechanisms. The required effort can be optimized with the use of LiDAR technologies, which support the process of collecting data related to spatial information such as location, geometry, and position. Sharing such data in multi-stakeholder environments is hindered due to competition, confidentiality, and security requirements. Multi-stakeholder environments favor the use of decentralized creation and update mechanisms with reduced data exchange. Such mechanisms are facilitated by Federated Learning, where the learning process is performed at the data owner’s location. Two case studies are presented in this paper, where LiDAR is used to extract information from industrial equipment as a part of the creation of a digital twin.},
