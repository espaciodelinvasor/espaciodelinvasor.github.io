The aim of the project IDQfLCC project is to:
- Develop a framework for data quality analytics of MAXIMO database,
the framework covers three essential aspects: diagnostic, prediction
and prescription.

- Develop, validate and demonstrate an economic replacement time
(ERT) decision model in the mining environment.

- Build a generic software considering real operational parameters as a
prototype demonstration in mining operational environment.
