The main purpose of this project is to develop and demonstrate
Real-Time Prognosis System (RTPS) to monitor the machinery conditions
and detect the degradation level to draw attention for maintenance inter-
ventions and for enhanced remaining useful life (RUL). These objectives
can be divided into the following sub-objectives:

1) To identify key performance indicators (KPIs)
2) To monitor the identified KPIs using real time online technologies
3) To analyse KPIs for forecasting of RUL and scheduling of reliability
centered maintenance
4) To demonstrate the optimizing the maintenance decisions for effec-
tive asset management
5) To develop technical guidelines to maximizing the availability,
safety, and useful life of dumper fleet.

Accelerometers have been placed on a  CAT 777D Off-Highway Truck. My work in this project is to use the accelerometers signals in order to monitor the condition of the suspension system and determine the Remaining Useful Life of critical components.
