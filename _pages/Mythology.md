I am fascinated by myths and religions. I can directly identify the Gods and stories represented in most greco-roman works of art. I can recite hours of histories of viking or greek gods and heroes. 

>I have traveled and visited many temples and holy places to study them. My favorite vists have been the Oracle of Apollo at Delphi in Greece, and the mythological place of birth of the Goddess Aphrodite at Cyprus. 



I used to live in the north of Stockholm, which is the are in the world with higher density of runestones. Most of the existing Swedish runestones are still preserved at the place where they were originally erected, which is often in remote locations. 

> When I lived in Stockholm I spent a lot of my free time as runestone hunter, finding  runestones and visiting them.
