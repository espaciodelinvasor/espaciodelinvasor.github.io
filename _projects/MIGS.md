This project has been conducted within the MIGS IV programme. MIGS IV is a 3-years programme that has been initiated by a consortium of 7 companies in the mining sector. This programme focuses on development of Mining Ground Support by addressing issues and challenges related to this process.


The traditional methods for monitoring  mine stability are based on
measuring  displacement  at  distinct  points,  or  using  visual  observations.  These methods imply large limitations when addressing mine stability and safety, as they only represent local conditions. 

With the progress of measurement technologies, the current paradigm for investigating mine stability focuses on the use of a variety of measurement technologies ranging from e.g. images, lidar, radar, ultrasounds, and so on ... 

This project focues on the study of Lidar technologies. Current LIDAR technology enables 3D scanning of sections of excavation for monitoring deformation by comparison with subsequent scans.
